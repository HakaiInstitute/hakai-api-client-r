This project exports a single R6 class for the R programming language that can be used to make HTTP requests to the Hakai API resource server. The Class provides a "get" method to make Authenticated requests to the Hakai API data server without needing to know the details of the authentication process.

See package [README](hakaiApi/README.md) for usage and installation details.
