# Hakai API R Client

This project exports a single R6 class for the R programming language that can be used to make HTTP requests to the Hakai API resource server. The Class provides a "get" method to make Authenticated requests to the Hakai API data server without needing to know the details of the authentication process.

## Installation

Before using this library, install it into your environment using the following in your R script:

```r
install.packages('devtools')
library('devtools')
install.packages('urltools')
library('urltools')
install.packages('httr')
library('httr')

devtools::install_github("HakaiInstitute/hakai-api-client-r", subdir='hakaiApi')
```

## Quickstart

```r
library('hakaiApi')

# Get the api request client
client <- hakaiApi::Client$new() # Follow stdout prompts to get an API token

# Make a data request for chlorophyll data
endpoint = sprintf("%s/%s", client$api_root, "eims/views/output/chlorophyll?limit=50")
data <- client$get(endpoint)

# Print out the data
print(data)
```

This script is also available at [./example.R](example.R)

## Methods

This library exports a single class named `Client`. Instantiating this class with the `$new` method sets up the credentials for requests using the `$get` method.

The hakai_api `Client` class also contains a property `api_root` which is useful for constructing urls to access data from the API. The above [Quickstart example](#quickstart) demonstrates using this property to construct a url to access chlorophyll data.

If for some reason your credentials become corrupted and stop working, there is a method to remove the old cached credentials for your account so you can re-authenticate. just do `client$remove_old_credentials()`.

## API endpoints

For details about the API, including available endpoints where data can be requested, see the [Hakai API documentation](https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/hakai-api).

## Advanced usage

You can specify which API to access when instantiating the Client. By default, the API uses `https://hecate.hakai.org/api` as the API root. It may be useful to use this library to access a locally running API instance or to access the Goose API for testing purposes.

```r
# Get a client for a locally running API instance
client <- hakaiApi::Client$new("localhost:8666")
print(client$api_root) # http://localhost:8666
```

## Contributing
The source code for the client class is located at [./hakaiApi/R/Client.R](hakaiApi/R/Client.R).
This class defines a number of public and private variables and methods that make this request client work. The development of this class was largely informed by the R project's [R6 class documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Introduction.html). To build this class into a R package, [this tutorial](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) was followed.

### Building the source code
If any major changes happen to the source code, it will need to be recompiled. Fortunately, this is very simple. To compile the source code, execute the [./build.R script](build.R), by typing `R < build.R --vanilla` into your terminal. This should update all the other files in the hakaiApi subdirectory of this project that require updating. Don't forget to push these changes to the Github repo
